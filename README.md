# Scalian-Blockchain

This is a project of Scalian R&D Lab, demonstrating a MVP for tracking supply chain products using blockchain. The main framework used for this case is : Hyperledger, Sawtooth. The project is divided in 2 part : 
  
  1. A first implementation of a Supply-chain product tracebility, with the possibilities of Creating, transfering and destroying assets.
  2. A PoC of a cryptography (t,n) threshold cryptography scheme that we will use in a second time to hide transactional infos and revealing them only for the authorized parties.
